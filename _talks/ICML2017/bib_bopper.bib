abstractNote={We consider the problem of selecting an optimal set of sensors,
as determined, for example, by the predictive accuracy of the resulting sensor
network. Given an underlying metric between pairs of set elements, we
introduce a natural metric between sets of sensors for this task. Using this
metric, we can construct covariance functions over sets, and thereby perform
Gaussian process inference over a function whose domain is a power set. If the
function has additional inputs, our covariances can be readily extended to
incorporate them—allowing us to consider, for example, functions over both
sets and time. These functions can then be optimized using Gaussian process
global optimization (GPGO). We use the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the
predictions made using a set of sensors at a particular time as an example of
such a function to be optimized; the optimal point specifies the best choice
of sensor locations. We demonstrate the resulting method by dynamically
selecting the best subset of a given set of weather sensors for the prediction
of the air temperature across the United Kingdom.}, booktitle={Proceedings of

  abstract = {We address the problem of online path planning for optimal sensing with a mobile robot. The objective of the robot is to learn the most about its pose and the environment given time constraints. We use a POMDP with a utility function that depends on the belief state to model the finite horizon planning problem. We replan as the robot progresses throughout the environment. The POMDP is high-dimensional, continuous, non-differentiable, nonlinear, non-Gaussian and must be solved in real-time. Most existing techniques for stochastic planning and reinforcement learning are therefore inapplicable. To solve this extremely complex problem, we propose a Bayesian optimization method that dynamically trades off exploration (minimizing uncertainty in unknown parts of the policy space) and exploitation (capitalizing on the current best solution). We demonstrate our approach with a visually-guide mobile robot. The solution proposed here is also applicable to other closely-related domains, including active vision, sequential experimental design, dynamic sensing and calibration with mobile sensors.},
