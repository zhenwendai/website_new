p(x|y) \int \sum \yM
$$

## Scalability is a big challenge for Gaussian process

Gaussian process is

GP computational time meta-analysis.

a gp fit on computational time. (what if we have a million data points?)

What about big computers?

What about parallelism?

So what else we can do?

cover different approaches:

1. Sparse GP
2. covariance matrix inversion
3. distributed GPs

## What does uncertainty in Gaussian process?


How to display math:

$$
p(x|y) \int \sum \yM
$$

Youâ€™ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:
