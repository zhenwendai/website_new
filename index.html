<p align='justify'>I am a post-doc in <a href='http://inverseprobability.com/'>Neil Lawrence</a>â€™s group at University of Sheffield. My research interest is to develop Machine Learning methods and applying them to Computer Vision applications. In particular, my research focuses on probabilistic latent variable models, approximate inference methods for probabilistic models.</p>
