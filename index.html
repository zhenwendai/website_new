<p align='justify'>I am a machine learning scientist at Amazon Research Cambridge with <a href='http://inverseprobability.com/'>Neil Lawrence</a>. My research interest is to develop scalable probabilistic models and inference methods for autonomous learning from real world data and experience. My current research focuses on scalable inference methods for Gaussian processes and Bayesian neural networks and automatic machine learning. I am also interested in probabilistic models for learning invariant and disentangled representations.</p>
